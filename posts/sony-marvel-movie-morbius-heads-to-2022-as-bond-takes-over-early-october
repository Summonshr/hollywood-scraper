<p><strong>Previous, Jan. 11: </strong>Sony’s&nbsp;<em>Morbius, </em>starring Jared Leto, has been moved back by seven months, from March 19 to October 8.</p>
<p>With Covid-19 cases raging as we await a calmer administration to set foot in Washington and deal with the nation’s health crisis, many are expecting this year’s Q1 theatrical releases to move. <em>Morbius&nbsp;</em>moves to a release date currently occupied by United Artists Releasing’s animated sequel The A<em>ddams Family 2</em>.</p>
<p>This is a major Marvel movie for Sony, and the studio is protecting it rather than sending the pic to PVOD.</p>
<p>In <em>Morbius, </em>Biochemist Michael Morbius tries to cure himself of a rare blood disease, but he inadvertently infects himself with a form of vampirism instead.</p>
<p>Daniel Espinosa directs off a screenplay by Matt Sazama and Buck Sharpless.</p>
<p>There are no other wide releases left on March 19, only IFC’s&nbsp;<em>The Last Call&nbsp;</em>and ICOC&nbsp;<em>My Brother’s Keeper&nbsp;</em>according to the most recent Comscore calendar.</p>
